This meant that designs focused on components that would be reusable, which in turn allowed the React components to minimise repetitive code by mapping over these pragmatic components. This applied from the individual design atoms, such as headings and buttons, right up to large components, such as the product carousels and the pages themselves. For instance, instead of repeatedly coding <p></p> tags and adding the desired styles to each instance, I created a <Text /> component which took props to set specific styles and could be used globally throughout the web app. Larger components, such as the product line carousels and product pages are also agnostic to the content within it, allowing them to be reused and development time to be sort.",

This allowed me to understand how and where React imports the components into the final root div to render in a way the browser can understand. During this process, I also learned about and applied frequently used javascript methods in React, such as mapping, Object destructuring, types of variables (const, let, var), states, hooks, and interfaces.
